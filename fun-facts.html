            <li>Johnny is a nickname for “John”. It is also a nickname for Jonathan.
            <li>The letter H is silent in the name John, unless you pronounce it Jone, which sounds like a girl’s name.
            <li>Johnny Cache was born in a tree and raised by bees.
            <li>My favorite Johnny Cache song is Beer For My Horses. I have it recorded off the radio on a cassette tape but I strangely can’t find it on the official albums, and I have all the official albums.
            <li>Johnny Cache’s first wife was named May. His second wife was named June. His third wife was an alcoholic.
            <li>When Johnny Cache gets serious, you should call him John Cache.
            <li>The New Testament name John appears to be unrelated to the Old Testament name Jonah.
            <li>There have been many famous Jonahs in history:
                <ol><li>The whale guy
                <li>Jonah Bobo, from Zathura: A Space Adventure
                <li>Jonah Hex
                </ol>
            <li>There have been 22 popes named John, but there was no John XX. If they reach 30, they will also skip John XXX.
            <li>I searched Twitter for “fun fact” and literally the second tweet was the one about no John XX.
            <li>There was once a rapster named 50 Cent (no relation).
